# VIAM TFLite Module Example
This example goes through how to create a custom audio classification modular resource using Viam's C++ SDK and TensorFlow Lite, and how to connect it to a Robot.
Refer to main.cpp and the comments throughout for more information. For other C++ module examples, refer to the [simple module example](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-cpp-sdk/tree/main/src/viam/examples/modules/simple) or [complex module example](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-cpp-sdk/tree/main/src/viam/examples/modules/complex).

This is a limited document. For a more in-depth understanding of modules generally, see the [documentation](https://docs.viam.com/program/extend/modular-resources/).
