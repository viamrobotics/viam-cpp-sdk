# VIAM TFLite Module Example
This example goes through how to create a custom audio classification modular resource using Viam's C++ SDK and TensorFlow Lite, and how to connect it to a Robot.

This is a limited document. For a more in-depth understanding of modules, see the [documentation](https://docs.viam.com/program/extend/modular-resources/).

TODO(RSDK-XXXX): Complete these README with usage information for the example tflite module.
