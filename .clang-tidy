# Globally Disabled checks:
#
# bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters: This warning is loud with no clear advice on how to fix the potential problem
# bugprone-macro-parentheses: Can break with boost macros
# readability-identifier-length: This complains about identifiers with length < 3 which is often not useful.
# readability-named-parameter: Useful to fix lints about unused parameters
# readability-implicit-bool-conversion: We have decided that !ptr-type is cleaner than ptr-type==nullptr
# readability-magic-numbers: This encourages useless variables and extra lint lines
# performance-unnecessary-value-param: TODO(RSDK-3007) remove this and fix all lints.
# performance-move-const-arg: TODO(RSDK-3019)
# misc-unused-parameters: TODO(RSDK-3008) remove this and fix all lints.
# readability-function-cognitive-complexity: No, complexity is subjective and sometimes necessary.
# readability-else-after-return: No, this causes code complexification
